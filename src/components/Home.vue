    <h1>Spirulina Suppliers and Map</h1>
<p><span id="redcolor">Spirulina</span>  is a type of blue-green algae that contains a number of nutrients, including B vitamins, beta-carotene, and vitamin E. Spirulina also contains antioxidants, minerals, chlorophyll, and phycocyanobilin and is commonly used as a source of vegan protein.</p>
<p><span id="redcolor">What Is Spirulina Used For?</span>
Among proponents, spirulina has been used to support a number of health conditions, including fatigue, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, and viral infections.
Purported spirulina benefits also include weight loss, increased energy, and stimulation of the immune system.
To date, few human studies have explored spirulina's health benefits. However, preliminary studies suggest that spirulina may hold promise for the following conditions. </p>

<p><span id="redcolor">High Cholesterol</span>
Spirulina holds some promise for lipid disorders such as high cholesterol or high triglycerides, according to a study published in the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism. For the study, healthy, older adults consumed spirulina or a placebo. After four months, spirulina was associated with significant reductions in cholesterol.</p>

<p><span id="redcolor">Allergies</span>
Spirulina holds some promise in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (nasal allergies), according to a review published in 2009. Indeed, a previously published study of people with allergic rhinitis found several benefits for spirulina consumption, including improvement in symptoms like nasal discharge, sneezing, congestion, and itching.</p>

<p><span id="redcolor">Diabetes</span>
In a 2008 study involving 37 people with type 2 diabetes, researchers found that those assigned to 12 weeks of spirulina supplementation experienced a significant reduction in blood-fat levels. Spirulina benefits also included a decrease in inflammation and, for some people, a decrease in blood pressure and cholesterol.
In another small study, 15 people diagnosed with diabetes who were not using insulin took 2 grams of spirulina a day in supplement form for two months. They didnâ€™t change any other factors of their diet or lifestyle. At the end of the study period, the participants saw a reduction in blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels.</p>

<p><span id="redcolor">Oral Cancer</span>
Spirulina may offer some protection against oral cancer, according to one small study of tobacco chewers with precancerous oral lesions. For 12 months, study members took either a daily dose of spirulina or a placebo. By the study's end, the lesions cleared up in 20 of the 44 participants who had consumed spirulina (compared to three of the 43 participants who had been assigned to the placebo group).</p>

<p><span id="redcolor">Possible Side Effects</span>
Although few adverse effects are associated with the use of spirulina, consuming spirulina may cause headaches, allergic reactions, muscle pain, sweating, and insomnia in some cases. People with allergies to seafood, seaweed, and other sea vegetables should avoid spirulina.
If you have a thyroid condition, an autoimmune disorder, gout, kidney stones, phenylketonuria, or are pregnant or nursing, spirulina may not be appropriate for you. You should check with your healthcare provider before taking it.
It's possible that spirulina grown in the wild can absorb toxins from water, such as microcystins (known to cause severe liver damage), pollutants, and heavy metals. Most spirulina sold in the United States is grown in laboratories.
As with all supplements, it's important to consult your healthcare provider before using spirulina to discuss whether it's appropriate for you and whether it can be consumed in combination with other medications and/ or supplements you may be taking.
